# Basic-Python-Tutorial-Useful-for-Data-Science

I used the following tutorial as part of my learning experience of python, 
I used youtube tutorial of "Corey Schafer" to learn the basic python tutorial including tutorial on Pandas and other resources needed for Data Science career
The following Python Tutorial could assist some upcoming data scientist to understand the basic python and can build on it but checking some other tutorial online where 
they can use real world data for practicing.
